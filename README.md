**Bitfari Improvement Proposals (FIPs) describe standards for the Bitfari platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and standards.**

Contributing
Review FIP-1.
Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.
Add your FIP to your fork of the repository.  
Submit a Pull Request to Bitfari's FIPs repository.

If your FIP requires images, 
the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the assets folder for that FIP as follow: assets/fip-year-number (for fip X). 
When linking to an image in the FIP, use relative links such as ../assets/fip-year-X/image.png.

Once assessed, a FIP is moved into Feasibility and a Core Contributor is assigned.  

Once the FIP has been implemented by either the protocol DAO or the FIP author and relevant parties,
the FIP is assigned the Implemented status. There is a 500 FARI bounty for proposing a FIP that reaches the Implemented phase.
